      <p>This video is just an appetizer. It was the beginning of my attempts to make an RPG many years ago with the Sphere RPG maker. It's a set of screenshot slides from an altered version of Trial and Error v. 4.0 by Dennis Rosenfeld et al.</p>

      <p>The Phaser 3 game screen below takes a while to load. Wait for it.Give it some time. It shouldn't take more than 5 mins.It usually loads within two minutes or less.</p>

          <h2>Mentored Experiential Learning</h2>
          <p><blockquote>"We need to stop building courses and provide an over the shoulder autonomous entity that knows what you are working on and can offer help. That help would range from just-in-time advice, to just-in-time practice in a new environment, to more prolonged course-like material when there is something complex to learn how to do. This is what important AI would look like. We should not have courses that provide information. We should have courses that provide experiences. And we need to provide mentors and peers with whom to have conversations. Those mentors should be people until we can build good AI mentors."<br>- Dr. Roger Schank, PhD<br>

          <p><blockquote>"Teachers need to be trained to be more like counselors, offering help and guidance, and more like seminar facilitators, helping people express themselves and confront others with their ideas. As they cease to be information providers they should become what many of them wanted to be in the first place: trained mentors. They must learn to help in areas that are inherently human where children and adolescents really need help. How to get along with each other; how to communicate better; how to deal effectively with stress; how to function in a complex society."

          <p><blockquote>“... I had been studying computer science for about nine years at that point, and had been teaching students how to develop software for about six years. Shouldn’t I have already known how to build web applications? It turns out …"</blockquote></p>

I'd give the top grades to those who made a lot of mistakes and told me about them, and then told me what they learned from them."<br> - R. Buckminster Fuller</blockquote>
