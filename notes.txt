The main branch is going to use a Phaser 3.90.0 or 3.85.0 CDN. 
Previous MitchyMaize versions on Glitch were designed around using Node.js
The Glitch branch contains the old code without external scene files.
Glitch uses a Linter that required all scene files to be listed as globals on a commented line at the top.
I have a second project on Glitch that I finally got external scene files to work on.
The problem with the old code had something to do with the tween code that I had to fiddle with to get external scene files to work the first time, so the second time I just commented out the tween code and things started working.
Iá¸¿ not sure what headaches I am going to get into trying to get a version working on Github i/o with a Phaser CDN.
