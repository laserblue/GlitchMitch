# Mitchy-maize

A Phaser 3, 2d, 3/4 perspective, RPG fantasy for illustrative and training purposes.

This is to be a simulation of a working maize breeding facility with Shrek™ and Donkey™ dream-like Walter Mitty type fantasy adventures for imaginative explorers.
In my dreams it would also be connected to a LABSTER™ virtual lab (secret location in the game).
There will also be a connection in the Conference room to an automated mentor and Skyped/video chat live Mentors.

`design notes.txt` contains notes related to the project goals, related projects for learning and testing use of Glitch, Phaser 3, ES6, Node.js, Express etc. and notes on the envisioned App and simulation levels. 

# Mentored Experiential Learning
>"We need to stop building courses and provide an over the shoulder autonomous entity that knows what you are working on and can offer help. That help would range from just-in-time advice, to just-in-time practice in a new environment, to more prolonged course-like material when there is something complex to learn how to do. This is what important AI would look like. We should not have courses that provide information. We should have courses that provide experiences. And we need to provide mentors and peers with whom to have conversations. Those mentors should be people until we can build good AI mentors." \-Roger Schank

>"Teachers need to be trained to be more like counselors, offering help and guidance, and more like seminar facilitators, helping people express themselves and confront others with their ideas. As they cease to be information providers they should become what many of them wanted to be in the first place: trained mentors. They must learn to help in areas that are inherently human where children and adolescents really need help. How to get along with each other; how to communicate better; how to deal effectively with stress; how to function in a complex society."

Learning Web App Development (2014 ) by Semmy Purewal

>“It turns out that there’s a pretty large gap between practical, everyday software engineering and programming as taught by computer science departments at colleges and universities.”

>“In early 2008, after about six years of grad school and teaching part-time, …”

>“... I had been studying computer science for about nine years at that point, and had been teaching students how to develop software for about six years. Shouldn’t I have already known how to build web applications? It turns out …"


# formerly hello-sqlite

A starter that has a database

- This app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
- To save to the database, remix this app!

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html`,  `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- Your app starts at `server.js`
- Add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
