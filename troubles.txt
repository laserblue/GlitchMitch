I finally got external javascript files running on the photon-phaser3-template project.
The bug was in the tweens code that I had to tweak to get external files running the first time.
I still don't know what the bug is because I decided to comment out the tweens code and get things running with just two scenes with images.
So now I should be able to work with ES 6.

Next up: Create a player object and get it running smoothly in and out of buildings and scenes.
center camera on player and follow player
create tilemaps for empty research station field (maybe a laser level in the middle of the field in full version)
complete the research station building exterior (find missing colonial roof tile or use flat roof )
create the building interior tile map with blacked out locked areas.
create the tile maps for Level 1 scenes (castle banquet, village square, chromosome 1 linkage map overworld, castle exterior, castle interior, helical stairway, secret garden)


Cumulative troubles:

found a way to make base64 tilemaps online without TILED. Crossing fingers that I can use the generated json files.
there is a slight problem involving using multiple tilesets that I am working on
I can make a new cumulative tileset for a map that uses multiple tilesets but then have to change index numbers on the old map or make a new map using the new tileset
look into how use of multiple tilesets in Phaser 3 works. Maybe indexing runs from first tileset into next tileset (????)

https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/#data

FIXED: still can't get photonstorm-phaser3-project-template to run external scene file sceneMain.js from index.js - example single file code works ok using provided logo or Glitch Assets folder CDN image

Wanting to be able to work offline has been the source of quite a few of the headaches because of the need to have an offline webserver, (was using Pydroid 3, python3 -m http.server) but now using Node.js in Termux (DoryNode is now very obsolete and won't work with Node greater than Node 6 (Now, current version of Node is 16 or 17)) and Express.js and security-related changes to Android 10 that messed things up for DroidEdit and Termux running Node.js

I need touchscreen/swipe code to move player sprites on an Android device but the touchscreen cursor plugin that worked for Phaser 2 does not seem to work for Phaser 3 and I haven't been able to get some other Phaser 3 swipe plugin working on Glitch yet.
I have some code of my own working using the pointer/swipe but it's still very elementary. Move sprite vertically or horizontally to pointer tap point, Move sprite vertically to top or bottom based on direction of swipe. Same for horizontal. currently swipe directions work but don't stop. sprite.x += 10 just keeps moving right continuously from one swipe right instead of moving just 10 pixels. 
Currently working on having sprite move a specific distance based on swipe direction so sprite will move off page/screen to offscreen location (followed by camera).


Without Babel I'm currently using ES5 for the mitchy-maize project but I want to use ES6 since that's the current form of javascript most of the Phaser 3 tutorials are using.
Add Babel? Is Babel still needed with modern browser? Phaser developer is still using ES5 in examples

The convenient Glitch autoload feature seems to be getting in the way a bit since I need to ignore all the advice in many Phaser 3 setup tutorials about installing nodemon but the question then is how Webpack in the photonstorm-Phaser3-template is implementing the auto reload and if it is clashing with the Glitch autoreload (???)

I finally solved the problem I had with tilemaps not working because the correct keyword is createStaticLayer or createDynamicLayer not createLayer (and yet, all the examples for 3.55.2 use createLayer as do the professional tutorials. I don't know if it was just a change made after v.3.21 or if it was changed back for 3.55.2 or what)
I'm getting quite angry and frustrated with Phaser 3 because I was up and running with making my own tilemaps and tiles in less than a month with Sphere RPG but with Phaser 3 I kept getting hit with a kind of feature creep where I have to keep learning something new or learn to use some change as the developer raises the bar. And then the developer is putting out code examples, which is great, except that all the professionals are using an entirely different modular format for the code.
Recently, I was stuck for quite a while trying to get tilemaps working that I had working on Glitch before, but it turned out that I forgot that I was successful in displaying the tilemaps on Glitch because I used createStaticLayer rather than createLayer which is shown in all the current examples for 3.55.2 and tutorials that were based on Phaser 3 version 16 or so.


I need to learn how to use rewind so I might create a throw-away project just to work out how to run Glitch, Node.js and Express.js and Babel.js together. (I think my browser might be using ES6 now so not sure if Babel really needed)
Using the birdy nam nam example on Glitch to work with rewind. 


Glitch Linter code needed regarding global variables such as ES6 imported scene file names?
(with ES5 should be able to put external scene file names in script in head or body sections of index.html file but had problems with that )

A project based on the Phaser 3 Webpack/Babel/ES6 template was created but there is a problem with the Glitch Assets folder that needs to be worked out. The template pulls assets from an assets folder inside a src folder and I can't seem to upload assets to the src/assets folder or load assets from the Glitch cdn Assets folder
I'm trying to figure out if it's a path configuration problem or if Phaser 3 has some problem with cdn images (but some projects do pull images from the github examples site) 
Maybe I need to add a line in the .env folder? Just more configuration headaches!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trouble:
the csv tile map is not loading or showing on the screen.
I don't know if its the code or some type of blockage, like from the text.

Solution for Arrays:
var layer = map.createStaticLayer("layer", tiles, 0, 0);

NOTE: used a different keyword (createStaticLayer() rather then createLayer()): 
map.createStaticLayer("layer", tiles, 0, 0); // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vs. 
var layer = map.createLayer(0, tileset, 0, 0); // layer index, tileset, x, y

the Phaser example and Hadley code does not work because a different keyword is required 
https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/tilemap/csv-map
https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6

    this.load.image('tiles', 'assets/tilemaps/tiles/catastrophi_tiles_16.png');
}

function create ()
{
    console.log(this.cache.tilemap.entries)
    // When loading a CSV map, make sure to specify the tileWidth and tileHeight
    var map = this.make.tilemap({ key: 'map', tileWidth: 16, tileHeight: 16 });
    var tileset = map.addTilesetImage('tiles');
    
//     
    var layer = map.createLayer(0, tileset, 0, 0); // layer index, tileset, x, y
    layer.skipCull = true;

  this.load.tilemapCSV("map", "../assets/catastrophi_level2.csv");

  const tileset = map.addTilesetImage("tiles");
  const layer = map.createLayer(0, tileset, 0, 0); // layer index, tileset, x, y // uses map.createLayer(0, tileset, 0, 0)
}
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 https://pretagteam.com/question/how-to-add-a-tilemap-in-phaser-3
 This is where I saw the code with scene in it.
 scene.load.tilemapTiledJSON(key, url); // JSON
 scene.load.tilemapCSV(key, url); // CSV

var map = scene.add.tilemap(key);
// var map = this.make.tilemap({ key: 'map', tileWidth: 16, tileHeight: 16 });
var map = this.make.tilemap({
   // data: tileIdxArray,  // [ [], [], ... ]
   tileWidth: 32,
   tileHeight: 32,
   width: 10,
   height: 10
});
var map = this.make.tilemap({
   key: 'map', // csv file
   tileWidth: 32,
   tileHeight: 32
});

var tileset = map.addTilesetImage(tilesetName, key); // key: texture key
// var tileset = map.addTilesetImage(tilesetName);  // key = tilesetName
// var tileset = map.addTilesetImage(tilesetName, key, tileWidth, tileHeight, tileMargin, tileSpacing, gid);

var layer = map.createLayer(layerID, tileset);
// var layer = map.createLayer(layerID, tileset, x, y);
var layer = map.createBlankLayer(layerID, tileset);
// var layer = map.createBlankLayer(layerID, tileset, x, y, width, height, tileWidth, tileHeight); // x, y : offset in pixels
 
I saw some Phaser 3 code for the preload and create code that was slightly different with scene.load
I did have a csv map working once here but had the wrong tileset so it had the wrong tiles.
There is something weird going on with the placement of braces too in addition to the confusion caused by photonstorm doing things one way and professional developers modularizing the code both with and without ES6.
Sometimes I have changed from braces on same line to braces under and the code worked with braces under but not on same line as preload or create.

ES6: https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/phaser-3-noob-guide-loading-tiled-tilemaps/
AND EVERYBODY USES TILED which I can't use because I don't have a desktop computer but maybe there is an online version available.
CSV, JSON, TMX

Can I switch out node and add the most recent Phaser 3 template with Babel and Webpack without losing all my code?
I've been avoiding Typescript because of the added complication of learning it in addition to javascript

Android 10 broke or killed the apps I was using to work offline. 
DroidEdit browser preview only works now if I put html files in Android/data/com.chromeblahblah...
Pydroid 3 http.server seems to run Phaser3 examples still but also seems to turn itself off for some reason so the browser then gives me an "I can't load the file" blah blah blah after i view a few examples. I'm not sure what is happenning. Is Android 10 shutting down background processes?

I can run the Phaser 3 examples on Android 10 because an http server is provided when I open index.html with Chrome browser.

I can't seem to resolve the npm error in Termux as easily as I did for Android 6.
I don't really remember what I did to get things working on Android 6 other than adding a path in $PREFIX or something like that. Now there is the Android/data/ folder as well.

Google search is pulling up a lot of different answers and the controversy re: Termux on Google Play vs. F-Droid.

The latest Glitch Node.js example adds the complications of fastify and handlebars (more stuff to learn, remember and forget)
I'm trying to use Moto Gestures on other devices out of habit after only a week and the Moto gestures left swipe back nav gesture interferes with DroidEdit's left swipe file list panel. I have to be very careful where I try to slide the left panel out to keep from going back to the HOME screen. 
Moto gestures are one more cognitive burden like DOS commands, Linux commands, multiple website passwords, etc. etc. 

I couldn't get the old Phaser 3 template to work with external files and the Glitch assets folder vs. the Phaser 3 assets folder. 
Phaser 3 is now in version 50 or 55 rather than 20 which I was working with.
I want ES6 on Mitchy-Maize but need to add Babel 7 or 8 and maybe update Node.js and webpack as well (then again there was something about browsers being able to run ES6 now on their own)
I got external files to work but then made a change and have not gotten the code back to where it was.
Maybe time to start using unwind?

there is some kind of glitch causing phaser text to disappear and screenal after 20s and onscreen keyboard for fire tablet disappears when space key pressed.maybetimedvery annoying
need to work with Node.js and Babel on Glitch
deleted Termux amd nginx to use Zoom but now internal storage is always full even after Zoom uninstalled.
Need to install Babel etc to this project so I can use ES6. (actually browser might be ok with ES6)

I need to use the time machine 

need to add swipe plugin or use 'move to pointer' with scene.activePointer etc.(installed swipe plugin on glitch but not working yet, maybe import code should go in server.js or need to add require in server.js?????)


loaded in a field map csv map and tileset but it was the wrong tileset so the map had the wrong tiles
I would like to get something like Mike Hadley's tilemaps up and running (https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6)
I would like to have something like a building with a door that when entered changes the scene to an interior view when door threshold crossed 
(or I could have a no roof area?) then change to gameover scene when some object is touched.
could have 1st and second floor open at same time ??? say, diagonally? not preferred -liked Sphere RPG look with map change and teleportation etc.

I found a room change example and so far only have scene.activePointer working so that the character moves in one direction when the active pointer is down
Have seen mozilla webpage on touch with javascript and phaser3, 
also looking at Kirupa example, 
dartagnan code was for Phaser 2 and website has been 'corrupted??', 
have touchcursor code but not yet back to where I had it working a few years ago with Phaser 2 (yikes)


no mobile TILED version but might be able to use an online version or online GIMP.Have a mapmaker on android that makes tmx files but user interface is a tad too small and I'm not sure how the layering works. Changing magnification takes a few minutes
https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6

can I add zones to a picture to block movement around objects like tree stumps and cliffs or should I just move to loading in a csv file instead and figuring out how to add hit zones etc.?

can't fit both Termux and Pydroid 3 in internal storage on Android phone (was very nice on temporary lent 32GB phone but new phone is 8GB and only 4GB available for Apps.
Added 32GB micro SDCARD as internal storage but purchased Pydroid 3 will not stay in external storage when phone shut off so can't swap Pydroid 3 in and out of internal storage)
Will use Pydroid 3 on old SG3 phone for Phaser 2 and Phaser 3 server and Python coding.
When I ran the examples with Pydroid 3 http server on new phone,I was surprised I didn't need to add the FIT scaling code so I just deleted the code on the other phone after trying unsuccessfully to save it to onedrive - zipped file took ages and I ran out of time and then accidentally deleted the zipped file)

DONE: If I change to destop site I get a screen that fits inside the phone but it's smaller than if I add the scale FIT code chunk. 
      Anyway, now I can view the examples and move through the folders (there is a bug in the back button causing it to go back two levels instead of one)
      NOT necessary: it looks like I will have to add all that code in for all of the examples a second time. (It goes pretty fast with delete and paste.) once in a while some height and width differences

Installed nginx in Termux to serve files and can serve Phaser 3 examples files in downloads folder
(node tutorials create an httpserver and mention reading a directory and express tutorials mention serving a public folder but it was so much easier using (python3 -m http.server) to serve files with all directory contents shown if no index file  )
(a bug in the back button of the examples code goes up one too many directories)
I can use DroidEdit to change the examples code in the downloads folder and code in storage/shared/ so don't need to use vim in Termux for them

    I changed the nginx nginx.conf file with vim to serve the index file in the /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/downloads/phaser3-examples-master/phaser3-examples-master/public directory

DONE: autoindex is working now. I changed the root folder to /data/data/com.termux/files/home (maybe it didn't work before because I was all the way down the path as far as I could go)
    I added autoindex on; and nginx -t is ok but directory files are not being shown but maybe the autoindex code is to be after index or in the http block (So much easier using Pydroid3)

I have the phaser3 webpack template running (takes a few minutes to load in logo image). 
I didn't figure out how to hijack the webpack devserver so I installed nginx
I have the glitch files for MitchyMaize but they are a little out of date and not up and running with nginx yet.
I can use vim just enough to move around, insert, delete and save files

???  installing express and routing

DONE: Task: set world bounds on movement enabled player sprite
Task: create a touch cursor with activePointer for moving sprite on Android phone. See if I can get TouchCursor Plugin working with Phaser 3. It might not work for Phaser 3.
Task: Load a CSV tilemap with a door to enter a building on it. Create a change of scene to interior of building when door threshold is crossed. 
      Consider making a roofless building with 2 floors on one map if there are problems relating to switching maps from exterior view to interior view.
TASK: move named containers as player/user controlled sprites (the conditional statement would have to change animation frames according to the arrow key pressed and move the sprite with the correct animation running)    

- Development on Android phones creates a lot of problems. Have not found mobile replacement for TILED but might use free online version or alternative.
- On ANdroid,The help dialog closes when I try to checkmark the checkbox re .env or when I tap on the Ask for Help button

- formatting the web page index.html
    the div containing text does not go full width when I shrink the Phaser Screen to fit the Android phone portrait screen
    Change media query? change size of Phaser screen? consult scale manager examples and try full resize rather than FIT?

Fixed: the interactive text problem was due to adding a closing parenthesis after ('pointerdown'
       problem: adding interactive text to gameover scene. Problem with using "this" keyword? 

Placed on a Backburner
- Getting ES5 external scenes working (use ES6 on photonstorm template project)
- upgrade package.json to node 10.x to make use of built in ES6 features
- toggle music/sound from Options scene menu or stopping music when GameOver scene called

In progress: Option menu items have transparent alphas to indicate nonfunctioning/disabled conditions

- word wrap for scrolling credits


Current Task
- load a csv tile map instead of a background image (got it working for one map but wrong tile set being used so wrong tiles used to create map
- loading tile map works but then can't get to gameover scene by clicking on scene

DONE: Used script ending of "Field of Dreams" as text for scrolling credits test (for educational purposes) 
DONE: got scrolling text working on Credits scene with bitmap text)

- not sure how to implement Quit on Credits scene with menu option to Return to Menu. Should player have to view scrolling credits on Credits scene after choosing Quit on GameOver scene? 

Backburner
Goal #1: Get external scene SceneMain.js running from /js folder with image background only.

/* Problem

   I have 8 scenes defined in client.js that run ok.
   BootScene, MenuScene, OptionsScene, SceneMain, GameScene, FSMScene, GameOverScene, CreditsScene
   I want to eventually run all of them as separate external files from a scenes folder
   I am trying to get the external file js/SceneMain.js to replace SceneMain in client.js
   I don't have Babel installed for transpiling es6 to es5 
   
   To solve this with ES5, this should involve:
       commenting out the SceneMain scene defined in this file (client.js) 
       
       putting <script src="js/SceneMain.js" </script> in the head of index.html // is the PATH correct? e.g. "./js/SceneMain.js"
       - checking what order to use for scripts in head
       making sure the Express routing is correct in server.js 
  
  Possibly doing something like this.scene.add or load.scene in preload or create of OptionsScene
    //    this.scene.add('sceneMain', SceneMain, true, { x: 400, y: 300 });

I'm having serious problems setting up a Node.js development environment on a phone with d/node.js (Android 4 no longer supported) or Termux(Android 6)
Using Pydroid Python 3 as a webserver for the Phaser 3 examples works great. 
Modified Phaser 3 example files for mobile viewport using Phaser.Scale.FIT
Had Phaser TouchCursor working on old Android 4 phone with Phaser 2. Not sure if problem with Phaser 3.
Got Pocket Git
Termux is isolated and folders in /storage/emulated/0/Git not accessible.
Made a phaser3 folder and installed phaser3.23.0
Installed Phaser Template (ES6) but got no repository field warning, npm patch availability notice and no start script notice
d/node.js has access to all folders and files but I'm getting lots of access errors and symlink errors etc. The instructions for how to update node are not working either.
